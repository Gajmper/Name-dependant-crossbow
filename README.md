# Name-dependant-crossbow
Minecraft 1.21.5 Resource pack

The new minecraft 1.21.5 update allowes us to make name dependant textures without any mods. I hope this crossbow tamplate will help you. There are others that allready did this but the one I found had this problem where if you continued holding right-click the fully charged crossbow would change into the first pulling stage (crossbow "hold right-click" crossbow_pulling_0 > crossbow_pulling_1 > crossbow_pulling_2 > crossbow_pulling_0 "release right-click" crossbow_arrow/crossbow_firework ) so I fixed it. Just change "templatename" to your desired item name and templates to your model name and folder name.
